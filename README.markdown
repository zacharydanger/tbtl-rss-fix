# Overview'd!

TBTL is a radio show which you can find at [http://mynorthwest.com/tbtl](http://mynorthwest.com/tbtl)

They podcast their show, but their RSS feed isn't in chronolocical order. They break their show up into 3 separate files 7-8pm,
8-9pm, and 9-10pm, but the RSS feed lists them in reverse order per day. However, this script fixes it by changing the pubDate
from their RSS feed. This causes problems if you want to "play oldest first" automagically.

Just copy the tbtl.rss.php file into a web server directory somewhere and subscribe to it.
